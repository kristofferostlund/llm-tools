# generate-interface-mocks

This tools generates Golang interfaces using [this prompt](./prompt.generate-go-mock-implementations.md). I've played around a lot with the prompt. I'm sure it could be improved and made more succinct, however it odes the trick and I'm happy enough with it.


I've found it sometimes doesn't follow the exact output format (mainly skipping the `filename:` part).
